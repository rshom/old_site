(This is a now page, and if you have your own site, you should make one, too.)

I have seperated from the Navy and am currently traveling the world. I have been keeping an Adventure Log as a private Facebook group. Contact me on Facebook, if you want to be invited. While writing this, I am in Cordoba, Spain.

I am currently applying for work as an engineer. [Click here](/hire) if you are interested in working with me or know someone who may be.

I'll be traveling back to the US in a month.
