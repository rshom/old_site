## Naval Service
##### 2012-2016

Upon graduation, I recieved my commision as an Ensign in the US Navy. After a brief temporary duty at the University's ROTC office, I began my career by attending training commands in California and Florida. Following training, Navy assigned me a role of Cryptologic Warfare Officer as part of the Information Warfare Community. I was sent to Navy Information Operations Command Hawaii, a subordinate command to Fleet Cyber Command/10th Naval Fleet. There I served as a Subsurface Direct Support Officer and conducted four Pacific Fleet Deployments. I requested and was granted seperation orders for 31 December 2016.

## Boston University
##### 2008 - 2012

I studied Mechanical Engineering at Boston University on a Navy ROTC scholorship. I joined the Boston University Information Lab and Design Space (BUILDS), a hackerspace, durring its early existense. I began getting heavily involved in the club, learning a lot about programming, electronics, and how to create new things. Here I gained many of the values and interests that I continue to have today. 

## Early Life and High School
##### 1990 - 2008

I was born in the small town of East Hampton, CT and spent my early childhood there. I spent most summers at my Grandparent's house in Newport, RI. At the age of nine, my family moved to Madison, CT where we stayed until I had finished high school. As a kid, I was involved nearly every sport but focussed down to sailing and wrestling by the time I graduated. In these I earned many local trophies, but no major successes. I wrestled the 103 lbs. weight class for all four years of high school, and sailed mostly Optis, 420s, and Lasers. From the age of 15, I worked as a youth sailing instructor durring summers which I continued to do through college.
