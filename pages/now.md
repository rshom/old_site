**_(This is a [now](http://www.nownownow.com/about) page, and if you have your own site, [you should make one](http://www.nownownow.com/about), too.)_**

I'm living in Newport, RI and temporarily working in CT for [Viking Equipment](http://vikingequip.com) as a project manager.

I am also looking for engineering work. [Click here](/work) if you're interested in working with me.

On weekends I volunteer as a race comittee member for [Sail Newport](http://sailnewport.org).
