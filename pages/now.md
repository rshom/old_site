Currently attending University of Rhode Island as a Graduate Student

Imaging Lab (URIL)](https://web.uri.edu/uril) with a focus on
developing drive systems for marine-based soft robotic manipulators
and the DEEPi cameras.. I also work for [Marine Acoustics
Inc](https://marineacoustics.com) as a software engineer.
