## Overview

The Green Book is a concept from submarines.
It is a comprehensive list of piece of equipment on the ship that is not functioning 100%.

Listed under each item is:

1. Description of the issue.
2. Date issue started.
3. Individual responsible[^1] for repair.
4. Steps taken so far.
5. Next steps.

[^1]: If everyone is responsible, no one is responsible.

Anyone can add an item to the Green Book.
When an item is added, the Green Book is routed up the Chain of Command to ensure full awareness.
The status of every single open item is briefed at every single [Daily Ops Brief]().

## Purpose

The Green Book enforces a principle that broken equipment is unacceptable.
Sometimes broken equipment is urgent and operations must be halted until the issue is resolved.
For example, you cannot drive with a flat tire.
You can, however, continue driving once you put the spare tire, or even a doughnut.
Neither is an acceptable resolution, but people drive around on thier spares all the time.
The unacceptable state exists because the fix ceases to be urgent.

A daily review of the Green Book reinforces the importance of the unresolved issues.
Additionaly, it ensures tracking without adding to the anxiety of trying to remember everything.
Empty Green Books are rare.
Everyone has equipment that cannot be fixed right away.
A handful of items being actively worked on is normal.

## Implementation

In simplest form, the Green Book is just a TODO list that can be written on a pad or whiteboard.
I the tag :greenbook: in Emacs ORG-mode and pull it up as one of the first items in my ORG-agenda.
The important part is that every equipment issue gets added to it, and it gets viewed everyday.
If the Green Book works well for groups where issues can easily get ignored such as a company or for roomates.
In that case it must be accessible to everyone, and items must be assigned ownership.

The first time implimenting a Green Book can be sobering.
Most people have dozens of significantly broken items and even more minor issues between their:

* Home
* Vehicle
* Office
* Computer/Electronics
* Sports/Athletic Gear 

Walk around your home/office and write down everything you are reminded of.
Do not try to fix any of it then.
Just write it down. 

Now, find some time, and knock off items as aggressively as possible.
Closing Green Book items is the most therapeutic activity possible when it comes to relieving anxiety.
It is hard to stop when you are on a roll, but you can rarely close out everything.
Many items can end up in a waiting for parts or similar state.

Whenever, the Green Book (and therefore the issue list) gets too long, it interferes with operations.
Take that as a good reason to halt to slow operations.
Tear into the Green Book until it gets under control.

Note: I have expanded my Green Book to what I call my Bullshit List to also include administrative tasks, information needs, and unexpected urgent tasks.
