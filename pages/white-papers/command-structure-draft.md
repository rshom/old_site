## Overview

Centralized planing with decentralized execution.
Preplanned responses
Stand up plans

Organizations evolve into structures that work, but setting them up can be complicated since the right combination can never be predicted.
However, the military has devised a universal structure that works as a great starting point. 
I use it to organize my life, projects, and any groups in which I find myself invovled.
Generally, the structure breaks out in this way.
My navy career was focussed on N-2 and N-3.

 - **J-1 Admin**: Paperwork of any kind.
 - **J-2 Intel**: Awareness of current and future external inputs
 - **J-3 Ops**: What you actually do
 - **J-4 Supply**: Logistics, finance, food, and shelter.
 - **J-5 Plans**: Future plans, standing plans, and pre-planned responses
 - **J-6 Comms**: Talking to other entities, 
 - **J-7 Training**: Teaching and prep of any kind
 - **J-8 Readiness**: Manpower and Moral

## Purpose

### Important vs Urgent

The system shifts the commander's (your) focuss towards operations by handling distractions. 
In the best possible scenerio, operations are well planned and handled by prepared systems.
Then the commnader's attention is on pushed has far forward into the future as possible.

The system differs from much productivity advice in it's sequencing.
Most gurus advise prioritizing the important and not getting bogged down in the urgent.
However, urgent tasks are urgent. You have to do them.
You can't redesign the ship while it's sinking. 
Well you can, but only if you can slow that process.

I don't think being swamped in urgent tasks is inevitable. 
I've seen the difference in literal ships that are and ships that aren't.
The former end up designated "not ready for OPS."
Only once did I see a Commanding Officer make this call himself, but he made the right call and got some respect for it.
He recognized that his ship was in a state of constant reaction to what was happening NOW. 
He also recognized that this situation was fixable with some extra time, and he was right.

Urgent tasks, while bullshit, often cannot be ignored.
If they can, they are not urgent and probably should be ignored.
If they can't, they are urgent and need to be taken care of immediately. 
Urgent tasks that are can't be ignored are either systematic issues or chaotic. 
The goal then is to design a system that removes systematic issues, and handles chaos.
Once the urgent is removed as much as possible, you can focus on the important. 
This system focusses on removing the urgent and leaving the important to the commander.

### Centralized Planning; Decentralized Execution

The goal is to plan out life in a way that creates automatic decision making during execution.
This frees the brain to think.

### Automatic Decision Making

If This Than That

## Implimentation

The R stands for Russ in my case.
I occasionally add in files that may be specific to an organization I am part of.
In that case, I use a letter that makes sense to me, such as W for work.

 - **R-0 OTC**: Officer in Tactical Command sets the overal goals for the system.
 - **R-1 AdminO**: Necessary evil. All paperwork, especially recurring paperwork, goes here and a file system for easy retrieval of paperwork and important documents.
 - **R-2 IntelO**: Situational awareness. Threat/Opportunity identification/classication
 - **R-3 OpsO**: Current Operations (COPS), and Future Operations (FOPS)
 - **R-4 LogO**: Logisitics or everything needed to handle ops.
 - **R-5 PlanO**: Future plans (FUPLANS), standing plans, standing operating procedures (SOPs), pre-planned responses(PPRs) and other prep work.
 - **R-6 PAO**: Public affairs, communications, and style.
 - **R-7 TrainO**: Improvements for COPS and preperation for FOPS/FUPLANS
 - **R-8 MWR**: Morale, Welfare, and Recreation plus readiness.

### **R-3 OpsO**: Current Operations (COPS), and Future Operations (FOPS)

OPS is what you are currently working on.
Sometimes OPS is really part of another directorate that happens to be your focus right now.

I include Future OPS (FOPS) and Current OPS (COPS) into OPS.
Ideally, COPS doesn't require much attention because you are just executing.
Poorly planned COPS require a lot of urgent activity.

Hopefully FOPS requires more effort which should be in the form of decision making and plan finalization 


### **R-4 LogO**: Logisitics or everything needed to handle ops.


### **R-5 PlanO**: Future plans (FUPLANS), standing plans, standing operating procedures (SOPs), pre-planned responses(PPRs) and other prep work.

Planning is split into two parts: future plans and pre-planning.
Future plans refers to future operations that you have not decided if you want to conduct yet or not. 
Maybe you are going to take a vacation to either Dublin or Cancun. Plan both, execute one.


### **R-6 PAO**: Public affairs, communications, and style.


### **R-7 TrainO**: Improvements for COPS and preperation for FOPS/FUPLANS


### **R-8 MWR**: Morale, Welfare, and Recreation plus readiness.

## Operations Pipeline

### FUPLANS -> FOPS -> COPS -> AAR/LL -> SOP

Future Plans
Future Operations
Current Operations
After Action Report/ Lessons Learned
Update Standard Operating Procedure

### Expected Issue -> PPR -> COPS -> AAR/LL -> SOP

Pre-planned Response
Current Operations
After Action Report/Lessons Learned
Update Pre-planned Response


### Unplanned Issue -> COPS -> AAR -> SOP/PPR

This is the real meat of the system.
Many urgent tasks are derived from a lack of systems to deal with them. 
Recurring issues that pop up unexpectidly should have Pre-Planned Responses attached to them. 
Tasks that are simply requirements of life should be handled by Standard Operating Procedures.
By definition, these aren't really Operations.
Therefore they should be distributed to other directorates as applicable.

## Conclusion

Completing operations is the end game, and operations are the projects that you choose. 
Nothing should come above them, because they are your choice for most important. 
Operations is also the most restricted since it depends on all the other directorates.
This shouldn't be surprising since, the other directorates exist only to support operations.
