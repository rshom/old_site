# Guide Phone to Mark
This is part of a larger project for setting up courses

## Find phone location

B1.0 can only find the phone's location and give an update time.

Currently it only works in firefox because chrome doesn't accept "non-secure" requests for location. While this is probably a good idea, it is something I need to work around.

## Next step is phone orientation

I think I might need to up my security before I get phone orientation.
